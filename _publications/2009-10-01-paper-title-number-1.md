excerpt: 'The Feynman-Kac formula provides a way to understand solutions to elliptic partial differential equations in terms of expectations of continuous time Markov processes. This connection allows for the creation of numerical schemes for solutions based on samples of these Markov processes which have advantages over traditional numerical methods in some cases. However, na\"{i}ve numerical implementations suffer from statistical bias and sampling error. We present methods to discretize the stochastic process appearing in the Feynman-Kac formula that reduce the bias of the numerical scheme. We also propose using temporal difference learning to assemble information from random samples in a way that is more efficient than the traditional Monte Carlo method.'

The Feynman-Kac formula provides a way to understand solutions to elliptic partial differential equations in terms of expectations of continuous time Markov processes. This connection allows for the creation of numerical schemes for solutions based on samples of these Markov processes which have advantages over traditional numerical methods in some cases. However, na\"{i}ve numerical implementations suffer from statistical bias and sampling error. We present methods to discretize the stochastic process appearing in the Feynman-Kac formula that reduce the bias of the numerical scheme. We also propose using temporal difference learning to assemble information from random samples in a way that is more efficient than the traditional Monte Carlo method.
