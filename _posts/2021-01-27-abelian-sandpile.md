The following is an animation of the abelian sandpile model on the lattice with 10e5 grains starting at the origin. Sites with no grains are represented by black, one grain is green, two is purple, and 3 is yellow. See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_sandpile_model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_sandpile_model) for a definition of this model. I will provide one for convenience once I figure out how to render LaTeX here.

Code will be made available on my GitHub shortly.
